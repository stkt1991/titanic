### Kaggle-titanic
This is a code in an Jupyter Notebook for the Kaggle competition, Titanic Machine Learning From Disaster. The purpose of this code is to use the machine learning model to predict whether or not they survived on the sinking titanic.

### Installation:

To run jupyter notebook interactively:
1. After you have installed jupyter Notebook,run the jupyter Notebook with `jupyter notebook`

>The Titanic was a British ship disaster that on its maiden voyage sunk in the northern Atlantic on April 15, 1912, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.
>There exists conclusions regarding the cause of the sinking (hit the iceberg), however the analysis of the data on what factors impacted the survival of passengers still has been continuing until now. 
>In this contest, we have to use the machine learning model to predict whether or not they survived on the sinking titanic.

### Purpose for This project:
For each passenger in the test set, use the machine learning model to predict whether or not they survived on the sinking titanic.

#### This Notebook will show basic examples of:
#### Data Pre-procesing
*   Importing Data with Pandas
*   Cleaning Data
*   Exploring Data through Visualizations with Matplotlib

#### Data Analysis
*    Supervised Machine learning Techniques:
    +   Decision Tree with 3 imput variables and 7 imput variables
    +   Support Vector Machine (SVM) with linear and non-linear
    +   Random Forest with default and gradient boost model


#### Valuation of the Analysis
*   Output the results from the jupyter Notebook to Kaggle in a csv.file.
